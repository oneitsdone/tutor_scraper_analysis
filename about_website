             you need from tutoring websites and visualize it to gain whichever insights you might
             need. If you go to the webscraper page, you can put in the URL for the tutoring site
             that you are looking to scrape data from. The scraper will retrive the data in a CSV 
             file where you can then analyze the data using the analytics page.
